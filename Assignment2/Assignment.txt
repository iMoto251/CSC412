2nd ed: Problems 4.1 (10 pts), 4.2 (5 pts), 4.3 (2+6+2 pts), on page 134, and problem 4.8 a,b only (3+4 pts) on page 135.
Extra credit: 2nd ed Problem 4.7 (10 pts) on page 135.

3rd ed: Problems 3.23 (10 pts), 3.25 (5 pts), 3.21 (2+6+2 pts; for part b prove that DFS as well as BFS and uniform-cost are all special
cases of best first search), 3.30 a,b only (3+4 pts).

Extra Credit: 3rd ed Problem 3.29 (10 pts). Hint: Use induction on the number of steps between a node n and the goal. For problem 4.1/3.23,
apply graph search, not tree search (as shown on slides), i.e., do not re-expand nodes that were already expanded before.
